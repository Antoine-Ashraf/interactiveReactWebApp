# Interactive React.js Web Application
This React.js web app showcases core React fundamentals through an interactive learning interface. Built with **functional components** and **React hooks** (`useState`), it dynamically renders UI elements based on state changes. Users toggle between React concepts (components, JSX, props, state) via `<TabButton>` components, triggering **conditional rendering** of code snippets, descriptions, and examples stored in static data files (`data.js`). The app emphasizes **component reusability**—`<CoreConcepts>` and `<TabButton>` leverage **props** for customization—and employs `map()` to iterate over data arrays for dynamic list rendering. Key technical implementations include **event handling** for state updates, **JSX** for declarative UI structure, and a modular architecture for scalability. Designed to separate logic (state management) from presentation (components), it highlights **React best practices** like prop drilling, component composition, and state-driven UI updates. Developed with Vite for tooling and optimized for clarity, this project serves as a practical demonstration of React essentials.
